Solr uses schema file to identify the information of the documents like field, field type and configs that affects the searching and indexing of the document.
Solr can be used without a schema file, which is known as a schemaless mode.
In this mode, Solr will guess the field type and load default configs.
But it is recommended to use a schema file before moving to production.
Here we are going to use managed-schema, which is the default schema file used by Solr and can be updated via Schema API at runtime.
